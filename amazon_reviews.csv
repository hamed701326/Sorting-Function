"6","Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket","Clothing","3","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2023","3","False","True","Very Cheaply made quarter button fleece pullover.","I want to love this sweater and I do for what it is. BUT THIS THING IS SO CHEAPLY MADE. The sleeve cuffs came unstitched after 1 day of owning it. It is warm for mildly cold weather and soft to the touch. But it is a barebones product that has very little ""quality"" about it. For the $25 it is; it is not a bad deal at all. I do still wear it, but I also bought a similar product from a more popular brand that happened to be a similar price but on sale and the quality is much more prominent. If you are looking for a sweater that you don't mind possibly trashing in the process of wearing it... get it! Also would like to add that it is fairly stylish for the price as well."

"55","Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket","Clothing","4","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2022","0","True","False","Warm and comfortable, solid value","This fleece is better than I expected - more heft to it than some thinner options, and I would class it as a solid midweight fleece, perfectly adequate for short trips on 30/40 degree dry days, with a thin t-shirt underneath. It’s a soft polyester, well put together with no flaws that I could find, and made in Vietnam. The sizing is pretty much spot on, I’m 6ft/180 lb and the XL is a good fit, generous enough without being baggy, except perhaps in the kangaroo pocket area where it does seem to flare out a little at the waist, but it’s manageable. I’m a big fan of the kangaroo pocket and this one is deep enough to stash a lot of stuff. The waistband and cuffs are finished in the same lighter color as the neck - though the elasticated cuff is a bit tighter than expected and it made it difficult to pull the sleeve up.

Just a couple of small drawbacks to note - the fleece is a magnet for cat hair, dust and other small debris around the house, especially in the darker colors, but that’s probably true of a lot of fleece material. Also, I wish the tag was printed on, the sewn-on one sometimes irritates my neck. But I can’t really complain - at only $20 for a fleece jacket this is a steal."
"56","Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket","Clothing","4","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022","0","True","False","Go size up, very comfortable","So first of all go size up because my husband typically is Large but he wanted this pullover in XL so he can wear it on top of the undershirt and button up shirt. So XL ended up being perfect fit. Now stitching inside the front pocket just a bit weak it didn’t rip but if you relax you hands in there potentially it might because we heard that pulling tread sound so might not want to put much weight in there. You absolutely should wash it before wearing it because material left little lints on button up shirt the first time. It’s really warm and overall quality is outstanding just need with minor pocket concern. My husband wears it to work now and it keeps him warm and it’s professional enough in his field of work."
"57","Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket","Clothing","5","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2021","0","False","False","Excellent Fit & Quality","My husband is 6’, 155LBS, slim/fit with long arms & a long torso. This pullover in size Large fits him great (his usual size in tops). The arms are plenty long (that is unusal), the torso is long enough & it is not sloppy baggy around the middle. It has a comfortably loose fit – he really likes it. He prefers snaps to a zipper so that is another plus.

The sleeve measure 27” from the top of the shoulder seam to end of wrist.
The length from the top of the shoulder to bottom of the pullover is 29”.

The fleece is a light/medium weight, super soft & really good quality. Perfect for cold weather & active sports in the snow (with a jacket over).

I machine washed in warm water & hung to dry. It comes out perfect."
"58","Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket","Clothing","5","Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2022","2","True","False","Great Style With Stand-up Camel Collar Outline","The Camel Collar and matching hem outlines really caught my eyes and stood out so elegantly to me. Love the stand-up collar as well as the snap buttons, very easy to snap in or out. The Camel fabric is like faux leather or some synthetic leather material, soft and smooth. I did wash it and tumble dried as usual without any issues or damages to the fabric. There was no running color, just some very faint residue color but was clear after the first rinse. No shrinkage also. the Polyester fleece is somewhat quick to dry as well. This size L fits me just fine, not too long or too small so there was no need to size up at all, just as my usual size L. I guess the only minor issue is the initial odor when opening the bag, maybe it's just a one-off from the colors and yours should be fine. After the first wash, everything was fine so not a big problem really. Overall, I really like this pullover with the Kangaroo pocket style. Very comfortable to wear, warm and looks really nice."
"59","Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket","Clothing","4","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2021","0","False","False","Warm and comfortable","I like the pull over, it is simple and comfortable. I can lounge and wear it or wear it outdoors in different weather. It is a bit short, but not terribly short. The size is pretty accurate, but I probably should've ordered a size up for a looser and oversized look. Overall, I feel good wearing it and it keeps me warm and cozy, that's all it matters."

"61","Amazon Essentials Men's Full-Zip Polar Fleece Jacket","Clothing","5","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021","0","False","False","Super soft and very comfortable","Amazon Essentials Men's Snap-Front Pullover Polar Fleece Jacket

I am tall with long arms, and find that men's sweaters and fleece fit me better than women's because the lengths are better. This is a soft fleece that is very cozy on crisp winter days. The pockets are deep enough to hold my hands comfortably and the length of the body is perfect on me (I'm 5'8""). The navy/light blue contrast is sharp looking. I have to unsnap the top two buttons to take it on and off easily, but when it is on and snapped up it is very comfortable on my neck and not at all restrictive."

Fits as expected - slightly snug around the shoulders but otherwise good fit.

Not the greatest of color combinations offered, so I settled on navy. Buttons feel and look great. Easy to pair or wear underneath a jacket in colder weather. Recommended. Reasonable price as well."

The pullover breathes really well and is very warm.

The fit was on point. I'm 6' 230 athletic builds and it was just right. The only negative was the length, it's an inch or two too long.

At this price point the fleece is unbeatable as it provides extreme comfort and warth."
